# Inventory Management System

This is a simple Inventory Management System implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. The system allows users to perform basic operations such as adding, updating, searching, and removing inventory items. Additionally, it provides the functionality to generate a full list of the current inventory.

## Features
- **Add Inventory:** Add a new entry to the inventory with an item name and quantity.
- **Update Inventory:** Modify the quantity of an existing inventory item.
- **Search Inventory:** Search for a specific item in the inventory and display its details.
- **Remove Inventory:** Remove an existing item from the inventory.
- **Generate Inventory:** View the full list of items and their quantities in the inventory.

## Usage

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-management.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd inventory-management
   ```

3. Run the script:
